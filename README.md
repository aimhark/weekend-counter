This was a student project a the beginning of my Weiterbildung. The instructions were:

1. Create a mini app that takes in a users name and returns the following;

    - A greeting with the users name.
    - Current day
    - Days left till the weekend

1.  **Optional:** Style to your pleasing & feel free to load/use bootstrap via CDN.

> Hint: Refer to the representation below, for an idea of what your result should look like.
